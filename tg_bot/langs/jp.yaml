locks_help: |
     Do stickers annoy you? or want to avoid people sharing links? or pictures?
     You're in the right place!
     The locks module allows you to lock away some common items in the
     telegram world; the bot will automatically delete them!

      • `/unlock <type>`*:* Unlock items of a certain type (not available in private)
      • `/locks`*:* The current list of locks in this chat.

     Locks can be used to restrict a group's users.
     eg:
     Locking urls will auto-delete all messages with urls, locking stickers will restrict all
     non-admin users from sending stickers, etc.
     Locking bots will stop non-admins from adding bots to the chat.

     *Note:*
      • Unlocking permission *info* will allow members (non-admins) to change the group information, such as the description or the group name

      • forwarding the `/setlog` to the group

markdown_help_text: |
      Markdown is a very powerful formatting tool supported by telegram. {dispatcher.bot.first_name} has some enhancements, to make sure that
      saved messages are correctly parsed, and to allow you to create buttons.

      - <code>_italic_</code>: wrapping text with '_' will produce italic text
      - <code>*bold*</code>: wrapping text with '*' will produce bold text
      - <code>`code`</code>: wrapping text with '`' will produce monospaced text, also known as 'code'
      - <code>[sometext](someURL)</code>: this will create a link - the message will just show <code>sometext</code>,
      and tapping on it will open the page at <code>someURL</code>.
      EG: <code>[test](example.com)</code>

      - <code>[buttontext](buttonurl:someURL)</code>: this is a special enhancement to allow users to have telegram
      buttons in their markdown. <code>buttontext</code> will be what is displayed on the button, and <code>someurl</code>
      will be the url which is opened.
      EG: <code>[This is a button](buttonurl:example.com)</code>

      If you want multiple buttons on the same line, use :same, as such:
      <code>[one](buttonurl://example.com)
      [two](buttonurl://google.com:same)</code>
      This will create two buttons on a single line, instead of one button per line.

      Keep in mind that your message <b>MUST</b> contain some text other than just a button!
